1) Pip install selenium
2) Install web driver that's needed, geckodriver for firefox, chromedriver for chrome, etc.
Note that the driver needs to be located in the path of the script, otherwise you'll receive an error.


Websites:
a) Gmail
b) Google Play Music
c) Youtube 
d) C1 

Trying to connect to gmail doesn't work because Google's security feature prevents it. Will try controlling
a pre existing window and firefox next.
